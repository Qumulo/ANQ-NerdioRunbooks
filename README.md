##  1. Purpose
The benefits and functionalities of integrating Azure Native Qumulo (ANQ) with Nerdio, focusing on streamlining business operations and eliminating performance issues. This integration simplifies operations and reduces complexity, enhancing resource allocation efficiency and leading to significant cost reductions. By providing an easy-to-maintain, comprehensive end-to-end solution, it enables quick setup and rapid deployment within minutes. 

ANQ revolutionizes cloud file storage, offering an elegant solution for demanding file-based workloads, while the seamless integration with Nerdio showcases unparalleled simplicity and a straightforward setup process within Azure Virtual Desktop. 

Additionally, the simple and predictable cost structure ensures no hidden surprises, and the outstanding performance capabilities are demonstrated through anonymized workload examples and benchmarking.

## 2. Prerequisites for ANQ
### 2.1. Creating a Dedicated Subnet for ANQ
The ANQ instance connects to your Azure subscription by using  _VNet injection_, an Azure-specific networking technology that establishes an automatic, direct connection between your resources and service resources without complicated manual configuration or  VNet peering.

VNet injection lets you:
-   Apply routing and security policies to your ANQ service endpoints by using the Azure Portal, CLI, and API.
-   Create endpoints that allow access to ANQ by inserting special network interfaces into your subnet. This process binds these network interfaces directly to the compute resources of your ANQ instance.

The service requires an owner or contributor role with access to your Azure subscription.
If you use a custom role which must have write permissions to the resource groups in which you create your  delegated subnet and service.

The ANQ service requires a dedicated subnet.

> [!NOTE]
> -   Your subnet address range should be at least  `/24`  (it should contain at least 256 IP addresses, including 251 free IP addresses and 5 IP addresses reserved for Azure.)
> -   Your subnet must be in the same region as the ANQ file system.

To apply a specific subnet configuration, you can first create a subnet and then select it when you create your ANQ instance.

1.  Identify the region in which you want to subscribe to ANQ.
    
2.  In the region, create a new virtual network or select an existing virtual network.
    
3.  In your virtual network, create a new subnet.
    
    Use the default configuration or update the subnet network configuration based on your network policy.
    
4.  Delegate the newly created subnet to  `Qumulo.Storage/fileSystems`.

### 2.2. Configuring Network Security Groups For ANQ

**Network security groups**  let administrators enforce networking traffic rules. You can assign network security groups to individual network interfaces or to entire subnets.

Because it is possible to create or remove network interfaces from an ANQ instance, we recommend assigning security groups to a delegated subnet.

To ensure that your configuration doesnâ€™t block a specific protocol, follow the guidance in  [Required Networking Ports for Qumulo Core](https://docs.qumulo.com/azure-administrator-guide/network-configuration/required-ports.html).

### 2.3. Load-Balancing ANQ Endpoints
Qumulo provisions multiple endpoints to allow access to ANQ. Every endpoint appears in the Azure Portal as a network interface with an IP address.

To avoid the bandwidth limits of individual endpoints, use **round-robin DNS** to distribute your workload traffic across your endpoints.

There are many options for customers to manage DNS in Azure: Azure DNS, Azure Private DNS, DNS appliances such as Infoblox or BlueCat, Windows Server (traditional AD), and even BIND. Regardless of the method, Qumulo requires a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Round Robin record resolvable by the clients to distribute them for balanced connectivity.

To ensure that client connections to your cluster are balanced evenly, you must provide a single namespace for your cluster. To do this, configure your DNS server to send a different IP address for each DNS request for your ANQ.

For example, you can set the TTL for each record to  `0`, or `1` to allow each DNS lookup for your ANQ to yield one of the configured IP addresses on ANQ.

### 2.4. Active Directory (or Entra) Account with Permissions to Join The Domain
To join an Active Directory (AD) domain, an account needs the following permissions:
-   Create computer objects in the AD domain.
-   Delete computer objects in the AD domain (if re-joining an existing computer account).
-   Reset computer accounts in the AD domain (if re-joining an existing computer account).

Typically, these permissions are granted to accounts in the "Domain Admins" or "Administrators" groups by default. However, non-administrative users can be delegated the specific permissions needed to join a computer to the domain.

### 2.5. Global Secure Variables

Nerdio Manager allows you to manage Global Secure Variables. These secure variables can be passed to scripted actions. The variables are stored securely in the Azure Key Vault and can be passed to scripted actions using the  **`$SecureVars.Variable_Name`**  variable name.

**Tip:**  This feature is especially helpful if you want to pass sensitive information to a scripted action without passing it via clear text.

To manage global secure variables:

1.  Navigate to  **Settings** > **Nerdio environment**.
    
2.  In the  **Secure variables for scripted actions**  tile, select the **Add**.
    
3.  To add a global secure variable, enter the following information:
    
    -   **Name:** Type the name of the variable. The variable name must be between 1 and 20 alphanumeric characters.
        
    -   **Value:** Type the variable's value.
        
    -   **Pass variable to specified scripted actions only**: Optionally, select this option to only pass this variable to the scripted action(s) specified. When unselected, it is passed to all scripted actions.
        
        -   **Scripted actions:** From the drop-down list, select the ANQ Deployment script.
            
> [!NOTE]
> The variable is listed in the  Secure Variables  column of each selected scripted action in the  Azure runbooks window.
            
4.  When you have entered the desired information, select  **OK**.

## 4. Preparing a Hybrid Worker Group

In the current implementation of Private Link, Automation account cloud jobs cannot access Azure resources that are secured using private endpoint. For example, Azure Key Vault, Azure SQL, Azure Storage account, etc.

The user Hybrid Runbook Worker feature of Azure Automation enables you to run runbooks directly on the Azure machine. From the machine that's hosting the role, you can run runbooks directly on it and against resources in the environment to manage those local resources.

To deploy an ANQ service, you need to use a  [Hybrid Runbook Worker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker)  due to that reason. 

Azure Automation provides native integration of the Hybrid Runbook Worker role through the Azure virtual machine (VM) extension framework. 

### 4.1. Deploying an Azure VM

### 6.2. Troubleshooting FSLogix With frxtray Application

The FSLogix **frxtray** application is a system tray tool designed to provide visibility and troubleshooting capabilities for FSLogix profiles and can be vital in troubleshooting FSLogix UNC connection related issues.

The **frxtray** tool is vital for managing FSLogix profiles, providing essential monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities to ensure smooth operation and quick resolution of any issues that arise.

#### Features and benefits of frxtray:

**1.  Status Monitoring:**
-   The **frxtray** tool uses a traffic light system to display the status of FSLogix profiles. A green light indicates an active profile, while a yellow light indicates an inactive profile, which can help quickly identify issues such as when a local profile exists instead of an FSLogix profileâ€‹.

**2.  Access to Logs:**
-   By double-clicking the **frxtray** icon in the system tray, you can access the profile logs, which provide detailed information about the profile status and any errors encountered. This is particularly useful for diagnosing issues with profile loading and connectivityâ€‹.

**3. Advanced View:**
-   The tool includes an advanced view option, allowing deeper inspection of the profile configuration and status. This can be helpful for IT administrators needing to troubleshoot more complex issuesâ€‹.

#### Location and Setup:
-   The **frxtray** application is typically installed at *C:\Program Files\FSLogix\Apps\frxtray.exe* if the default installation path is used. It's part of the standard FSLogix client installation and can be set up to start automatically for all users by placing it in the startup folderâ€‹.
